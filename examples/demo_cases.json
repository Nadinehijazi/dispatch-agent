      "recommended_action": "Open a streetlight outage work order for NYC DOT Street Lighting for the lamp directly above the crosswalk at the intersection of Main St and 3rd Ave in Queens (adjacent to the grocery store). Dispatch a street lighting crew to inspect and repair (replace lamp/ballast or remediate electrical/pole issues), verify the pole ID and circuit, test nearby fixtures for related outages, and document repairs with photos and notes. If the crew identifies exposed wiring, a damaged pole, or other immediate safety risks, escalate to an emergency response team and notify NYPD for pedestrian/traffic control as needed.",
      "justification": "Street lighting outages are handled by NYC DOT Street Lighting. The report gives a clear location (Main St & 3rd Ave, lamp above crosswalk by grocery store) and notes the light has been out for seven days causing reduced nighttime visibility for pedestrians. While this increases risk, there is no report of an active immediate life-threatening condition, so urgency is low but repair is warranted promptly. The recommended action sends a maintenance crew to inspect and fix the outage and escalate if hazardous conditions are found.",

Simultaneously refer to DOHMH Rodent Control for inspection and abatement (baiting/trapping) due to the reported rat sighting at ~23:00 and ongoing food attractants. Open a recurring-issue enforcement referral to DSNY to notify the property owner/occupant of sanitation rules and pursue follow-up enforcement if violations continue; request DOHMH follow-up monitoring after abatement. Notify reporter of scheduled pickup/inspection times.",
      "justification": "Torn bags with exposed food waste present an attractant for rodents; rats were observed at the site and the problem has persisted/recurs over multiple days, so both removal of refuse (DSNY) and rodent inspection/abatement (DOHMH) are needed, plus enforcement to address recurring violations.",
